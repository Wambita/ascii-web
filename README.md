## Introduction
Ascii-art Web is a project that hosts webpages for users to generate Ascii-Art of their desired text with their desired banner. The user is presented an area for them to type their desired text. If the character is among the printable ASCII character range  it is displayed this includes,numerics and symbols.

### Features 
+ Convert text to ASCII art using varius banner files
+ Interactive web interface for  creating ASCII art.
+ Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.


## Installation 

Download the Go installer from the official [Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

Verify your installation by opening a command prompt and typing `go --version`. This should print the installed version of Go.


To set up ASCII Art Web locally, follow these steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/shfana/ascii-art-web.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ascii-art-web

# Install dependencies

`sudo apt install go -all`

# Start the ascii-web server
go run .
```

## Usage
After installation, you can access the web application by navgating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)



You will receive the following message on your terminal
```bash
Server is starting at http://localhost:8080
```
![home](/assets/images/home.png)
 

- These are the various parts of the home page 

![instructions](/assets/images/instruct.png)


 + Navbar - The navbar links to other pages of the application

 + The Input section - where the user keys in the input they want to generate to art

 + banner selection - The user has three options of banner files to choose from. (shadow, thinkertoy and standard)

 + The submit button - The user presses this button to generate the art that is displayed in the output section.

 + The footer  - This section contains the copyright disclaimer and an icon that has a  link to the repository.

The user can select one of the three available fonts/banner files to display their input in art form.

This project comes with three predefined ASCII fonts, located in banner files:

  - [`shadow`](https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/ascii-art/shadow.txt)
  - [`standard`](https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/ascii-art/standard.txt)
  - [`thinkertoy`](https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/ascii-art/thinkertoy.txt)


**- Each character is represented over 8 lines, providing a clear and sizable output.**

**- Characters are separated by a new line `\n`.**

### Creating ASCII Art

   1. Enter your desired text in the input field
   2. Select a banner style from the dropdown menu
   3. Click "Generate" to create your ASCII art


- From the example where the user has typed "hello" in the input field and selected  the `standard` banner. 
- The output should be shown as seen in the image below
![output](/assets/images/outputS.png)

- In the case of input `Hello` and `shadow` banner selected, the output is as shown below
![shadow](/assets/images/ouputSh.png)


- In the case of input `Hello` and `thinkertoy` banner selected.
![thinkertoyinput](/assets/images/thinkertoy%20input.png)

- Output is as shown below
![thnkertoyoutput](/assets/images/thinkertou%20output.png)

- Bad Requests: They occur when

    - The user does not give an input
    - The user gives an input that is not within the printable ASCII character range (from space to tide `~`). There are 95 characters in total

An example of a bad request is shown below(the user tries to input chinese characters or emojis)
![badrequest](/assets/images/badrequest.png)

The Following error is returned.
![badreq](/assets/images/badrequestout.png)

The user can click `go back` to return home to try using the program again


- In the case where a user tries to navigate to a non existent page or use a banner file that is not  available, he/she gets a 404 not found error

- Internal server error occurs when an error occurs from the program and is not a user error.

## Implementation detail: algorithm

* ### assets
#### Favicon
It's an icon that represents a specific page and is unique for every website. If you look at the highlighted icon on the image below, the highlighted favicon helps you find the website easily.


![alt text](<assets/images/favicon.png>)

* #### Images
    Images used within the project are stored here.
* ### ascii

Ascii folder hold the basic project for producing the art
* #### Art

Art combiness the line of Ascii art per slices of the input string and predefined mapping.

* #### Acsii Art Map

AsciiArt maps uses maps to map a particular character to it's art representation.

* #### Ascii Combine

Ascii Combine Handles newlines aspect in input string,combines all input slices' asciiArt

* #### CheckAssets

CheckAsets compares local banner files to the ones in the cloud and updates them if necessary.

* #### Input

Input handles the command feed by the user on the webpage specifically the type of banner they want to use and the text they want to change.

* #### Tab

Tab handles the control character /t which print double space in the ascii folder.

* #### Resources

Resources folder holds all the text resources we use to either text or


* ### Handler
* #### func AboutHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)

    Handles any error that occures while trying to run the about page.

* #### func HomeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) 

    Handles any error that occures while trying to run the homepage

* #### func InstructionsHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)

   Handles any error that occures while trying to run the instruction page.

* #### func ErrorPageHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, statusCode int, message string)

    Displays any errors that occur in any of the webpage.

* #### func ArtHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) 

    Handles any error that occures while trying to run the ascii function and the character is not printable.

#### func ArtHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) 

### Static
* #### err.sss
    Handles consistency in the program

* #### styles.css
    Handles the stylesheets used in the website.


* ### Template
Each template here handles the design and layout of the specified pages which are 
    1. about.html for the about page
    2. error.html for the error page
    3. index.html for the home page 
    4. instructions.html for the instruction page

* ### Tests

This folder handles the test files used to test the various parts of the code to confirm if each part of the code is working smoothly.

* ### main.go

This is where the handlers in handler file are called and the where the server is run from.

## Limitations
This project can only print characters in the printable ASCII range from space to tilde `~`. When other characters outside the range are used, the program returns a bad request error.

Be light on using the character combination "\n" and "\r"
as they  represent newline (or same as you press enter button)
